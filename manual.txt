LOCAL PASSWORD MANAGER very early version

Brief: Simple password manager that stores your passwords encrypted
in text file.

Encryption: AES-256 Algo CBC mode. Provided with - Crypto++ 8.9.0
Requires Crypto++ 8.9.0 and C++11 for build.

Usage: after build create /vault directory in project folder. Then create data.txt 
and keys.txt in it. Now you can run your program. When you finish take keys.txt file 
away from /vault. The main idea is to store keys.txt somewhere in safe place not next
to data.txt file.

You can edit or delete your files manually but remember - single data.txt
file associated with single keys.txt file. They need each other in line-by-line
format to work correctly. In case that you edit your files manually no garantee
for correct work.

You can also delete some of your saved passwords in runtime session.
In that case key of chosen password sets to 00000... and you can
never decrypt it again.
